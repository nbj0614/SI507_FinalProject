Welcome to the Book Recommendation System!

This application will give you book recommendations in the category of your interest from the New York Times Bestsellers list.
To get book recommendations, you must select a category of your interest (the application will give you a multiple-choice question). Then, it will ask you a couple more questions to see if you are interested in any specific authors and/or topics, which are optional. If you type in any author names and/or topics, the application will give you book recommendations based on the information you provided. If you simply press enter and do not provide any author and/or topic information, it will give you one random book recommendation in the category of your choice. The recommended books are added to your virtual library. You can add as many books as you want to your library. When you select to 'show my library,' it will open a web browser which will display more detailed information about the books in your library. The detailed information comes from Google Books API. Please note that when you end this application, the library will be gone. 

That's all you need to know to use this application. Don't worry if you don't fully understand what this document says. Once you start the application, it will guide you. Please enjoy!
